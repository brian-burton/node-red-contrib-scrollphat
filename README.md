# node-red-contrib-scrollphat

This project was borne of a desire to help the Raspberry Pi Foundation create node.js (and therefore Node Red) native code to use as part of their curriculum.

To do that, I first had to write some code that would prove the viability (and my ability) to work natively in Javascript, rather than just wrapping the existing Python libraries in exec calls.

## What is this, then?

A set of nodes for NodeRed, using native Javascript with the help of the [i2c](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i2c) node.js library.

## How do I use it?

You can't "npm install" this yet because it's still in development. You can "git clone" and then "npm install -g" in a directory. It may or may not work, so you pays your money and you takes your choice until this README says otherwise...
